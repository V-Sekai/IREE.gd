# `iree.gd`

[IREE](https://github.com/openxla/iree) runtime in Godot through GDExtension, a mission to run machine learning model (e.g. Tensorflow lite) natively in Godot.

## Overview
This GDExtension provides:
* `IREETensor` - Hold data to be fed into or output by the model. 
* `IREEModule` - Load model and run it.

### Preparation
You'll need to generate `.vmfb` bytecode in vulkan format before using `iree.gd`. 
Good thing is that there is are [scripts](./tools) helping you to generate those bytecodes! Use them well!

But it might not 100% work, if this happens, you'll need to do it in a manual way following this [guide](https://openxla.github.io/iree/guides/).
Make sure you are generating the bytecode in vulkan format and also identify the input/output type.

Here we can know that: 
* The function name is `"module.main"`
* The function takes one `1x50x50x3` float 32 `IREETensor` (`input_0`) as input.
* The function takes one `1x200x200x3` float 32 `IREETensor` (`Identity`) as input.

### Using `iree.gd`
After having your `.vmfb` bytecode ready, you could start using `iree.gd`.

There are 4 steps:
1. Load model with `IREEModule.load`.
2. Prepare input by feeding data into `IREETensor` through `IREETensor.from_*` variant or `IREETensor.capture_*` variant.
3. Send `IREETensor`s into loaded `IREEModule`.
4. Interpreting the output `IREETensor`s from `IREEModule`.

```swift
var module := IREEModule.load("res://model.vmfb")
var input := IREETensor.from_bytes(image.get_data(), [1, 50, 50, 3]) # Remember to consider the input type.
var outputs := module.run_module("module.main", [input])
for output in outputs:
    pass # Do something with the `output`.
```

## Sample project
The sample project is in `sample` directory. You'll need to generate the bytecode before running them.

## Build from source
Run these commands: 
```sh
git clone https://github.com/RechieKho/iree.gd.git # clone this repo
cd iree.gd
git submodule init thirdparty # initialize all the thirdparty
git submodule deinit thirdparty/iree/third_party/llvm-project # Deinitialize llvm, we are not compiling the compiler.
git submodule update --recursive # Pull submodule content, this will take a while.
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . # Building the project, this will take a while, add `-j` flag to make it faster.
```

If you would like to compile LLVM from source, you'll need to set `IREE_BUILD_BUNDLED_LLVM` to `ON` when generating build files with cmake.

After compilation, the library will be in `build/lib` directory.
It will also update the library in the sample.
